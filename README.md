# customer_churn_prediction
📉 Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting customer churn — identifying which customers are likely to leave a service — using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to help businesses take proactive actions to retain at-risk customers.
🔍 Problem Statement
Customer churn significantly impacts revenue and growth. By analyzing patterns in customer behavior, we can build a model to predict churn and improve retention strategies.

 📁 Dataset
The dataset includes customer demographics, service details, and churn labels (`Yes`/`No`). It is cleaned and preprocessed for building predictive models.

 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (EDA)
- Scikit-learn (ML Models)
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- XGBoost

 📊 Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
   - Handling missing values, encoding, scaling
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualizing patterns and correlations
3. Class Imbalance Handling
   - Applying SMOTE to balance target classes
4. Model Building
   - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
5. Model Evaluation
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
6. Model Interpretation
   - Feature importance analysis

 📈 Results

Achieved high performance on test data, with improved recall and AUC after balancing and tuning. The model can successfully flag potential churners for retention campaigns.

 ✅ Future Improvements

- Add hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Integrate SHAP for model explainability
- Build a Streamlit web app for predictions

 📌 Project Status

✅ Completed basic version  
🚧 Advanced improvements in progress
